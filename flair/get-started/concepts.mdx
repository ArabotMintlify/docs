## 1.  Agents

An AI agent in Flair is a system powered by LLM that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use it to perform self-determined tasks to achieve predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions to take to achieve those goals.

## 2. Tools  

An AI Agent has tools. **Tools** enable agents to perform tasks beyond language generation, such as retrieving structured or unstructured data and executing custom code. We can think of these tools as  interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world.

A **tool** in Flair is designed to **do one thing well**, following a focused, single-responsibility principle.

A **tool**  can also support **different backend configurations**, enabling flexible use cases.

For example:

- A _Search Tool_ might connect to Google, or Bing
- An _Image Generation Tool_ might use DALLÂ·E, or Midjourney

## **3.  Flows**

A **Flow** defines how a group of AI agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks to achieve an overall objective. It specifies the sequence and logic that govern the execution of tasks by agents within a given workflow.

A Flow typically includes:

1. **Agents**: Autonomous AI entities that perform specific tasks.
2. **Tasks**: Individual actions or responsibilities assigned to agents.
3. **Execution Order**: Defines the order and dependencies among tasks, controlling which agent performs which task and when.
4. **Data Passing**: How information generated by one agent or task is passed and utilized by others.
5. **Conditions and Branching**: Decision points that determine which paths agents follow based on outcomes or dynamic conditions.

Flows enhance the coordination, scalability, and effectiveness of agent-driven tasks, especially when dealing with complex, multi-step projects.
